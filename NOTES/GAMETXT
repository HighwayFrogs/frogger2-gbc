 FIVE LITTLE FROGS
  WANDERED ACROSS
  THE POND. YOU'D
  BETTER GO LOOK
     FOR THEM.
THE GUY WHO GAVE ME
DIRECTIONS SAID I'D
COME TO A DEAD END.
I WONDER IF HE MEANT
   ME OR THE ROAD?
 WATCH OUT FOR THE
  WALL OF 'DOZERS.
    THERE'S BEEN
    AN OIL SPILL.
   WHO'S SLIDE ARE
       YOU ON?
      OH NO!
 SOMEONE MUST HAVE
A FLAT TIRE. I HEAR
  LOTS OF HISSING.
  HOW COME ALL THE
  OTHER FROGS KNOW
     HOW TO SWIM?
  WELCOME TO THE
  TREASURE ROOM.
  THIS IS A GREAT
 TIME TO BE GREEDY.
 GUESS IT'S MY TURN
    AT BAT AGAIN.
  YIKES.  ANOTHER
  TREASURE ROOM. I
  WONDER IF ANY OF
 THESE SPIDERS HAS
    A WEB SITE?
   I'LL TREASURE
   THESE MOMENTS.
  WOW. YOU MADE IT
  THIS FAR. THAT'S
     FANTASTIC.
  THIS PLACE LOOKS
  DANGEROUS. I HEAR
RUMBLING -- AND IT'S
    NOT MY STOMACH.
  SOMETIMES I FEEL
      LIKE I'M
   WALKING ON AIR.
  WANT SOME ADVICE?
     NO STOPPIN',
    KEEP HOPPIN'.
 THE BOLDER I GET,
 THE MORE BOULDERS
       I GET.
    DO YOU LIKE
     THE MUSIC?
 IT'S CROC AND ROLL.
 HEY, I DON'T HEAR
 ANY MORE RUMBLING.
   THAT'S GREAT...
      I THINK...
  THIS IS AN ICE
  PLACE TO VISIT,
  BUT THERE'S SNOW
  PLACE LIKE HOME.
THIS PLACE GIVES ME
THE CHILLS. AND THE
 LAST THING A FROG
NEEDS IS GOOSEBUMPS.
   LIFE HAS IT'S
   UPS AND DOWNS.
    SO DOES ICE.
  ODDLY ENOUGH, I
 DON'T FEEL SO HOT.
    I THINK I'M
    CATCHING A COLD.
I'M SO COLD I CAN'T
  FEEL MY THUMBS.
 WAIT, I FORGOT...
 FROGS DON'T HAVE
   ANY THUMBS.
     CHILL OUT.
 COOL, AN OLD MINE.
  I COULD FALL FOR
 A PLACE LIKE THIS.
   MINE YOUR OWN
     BUSINESS.
  TIME TO BOLDLY
CROAK WHERE NO FROG
 HAS CROAKED BEFORE.
  THIS LOOKS LIKE
  A PLACE TO FIND
 FLAME AND FORTUNE.
  A FROG WHO LEAPS
    WITHOUT FIRST
       LOOKING,
  ENDS HIS DAYS IN
   LAVA, COOKING.
     IF I DON'T
    GET THROUGH,
    I THINK I'LL
     GET FIRED.
I'LL HAVE TO CROSS
 THIS LAVA RIVER
  ASBESTOS I CAN.
  I'LL HAVE SOME
  RIBBITING TALES
 TO TELL IF I EVER
   GET BACK HOME.
OH NO. NOW IT LOOKS
LIKE MY GOOSE BUMPS
  WILL GET COOKED.
HI. I'M TADIUS.
KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR ME DURING
YOUR ADVENTURE.
I'LL GIVE YOU A
TIP WHENEVER I CAN.
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT TO DO HERE --
AVOID CARS, RIDE
THE LOGS, AND DON'T
FALL IN THE WATER.
GOOD LUCK.
ROUGH ROAD.
GLAD YOU MADE IT.
AS YOU CROSS THE
REST OF THE POND,
YOU'LL NOTICE THAT
SOME TURTLES SINK
BENEATH THE WATER.
MAKE SURE YOU HOP
OFF BEFORE THEY
GO UNDER.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HERE'S A TIP:
SNAKE'S HEAD
MAKES FROG DEAD.
SNAKE'S BACK
CAN'T ATTACK.
I HEARD A SNAKE
ONCE SCARED A MAN
SO MUCH THAT HE
DROPPED FOUR GEMS
IN THE TALL GRASS.
BY THE WAY, DID YOU
FIND THE CHECKPOINT
IN THE WATER? IT'S
EASY TO SLIP UP
AROUND HERE SO YOU
MIGHT WANT TO PAY
IT A VISIT.
WELL DONE.
THAT BURROW TO THE
LEFT SHOULD LEAD
YOU WHERE YOU NEED
TO GO.
THE POND IS A
LOT LIKE LIFE.
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
BEST TO JUMP AT THE
FIRST OPPORTUNITY
THAT FLOATS BY.
ON THE OTHER HAND,
OR OTHER FLIPPER,
IF YOU WAIT TOO
LONG, YOU'RE SUNK.
YOU CAN RIDE THE
MOVING BELT. BUT
WATCH OUT FOR THOSE
GLOWING CAULDRONS.
THEY LOOK RED HOT.
YOU CAN RIDE THE
GATOR'S BODY.
JUST STAY AWAY
FROM THE SNOUT.
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO DASH STRAIGHT
TOWARD THE NORTH.
BUT SOMETIMES YOU
NEED TO ZIG-ZAG
BACK AND FORTH.
YOU CAN LEAVE THE
INVISIBLE PATH
FOR A PLATFORM
AND SAFELY RETURN.
BUT YOU CAN'T GO
BACK TO THE SPOT
YOU LEFT. YOU MUST
GO TO THE NEXT
STEP ON THE PATH.
ON SLIPPERY ICE,
IT'S BEST TO PLAN
AHEAD. BE SURE TO
LOOK ALL AROUND AND
SEARCH CAREFULLY
FOR THE PATH.
YOU'RE IN LUCK.
THOSE ARE PELCZARSKI
PENGUINS UP AHEAD.
THEY'RE FRIENDLY AND
HAPPY TO GIVE YOU
A RIDE.
BE VERY PATIENT.
WATCH FOR FISH
CROSSING YOUR PATH
BEFORE YOU JUMP.
AND DON'T JUST
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE
GOING. PAY SOME
ATTENTION TO WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN. THE
INFORMATION MIGHT
COME IN HANDY LATER.
I'M FREEZING.
ENOUGH OF THIS.
I'M GOING TO FIND
SOME PLACE THAT'S
NICE AND WARM.
BY THE WAY, YOU CAN
JUMP BACK AND FORTH
BETWEEN RIDES THAT
ARE MOVING IN
OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
WHILE YOU WAIT FOR A
SAFE CHANCE TO
MOVE AHEAD.
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GO
WITH THE FLOW.
BUT WHEN YOU GO
AGAINST THE FLOW,
YOU'LL FIND IT'S
EASIER IF YOU DASH
JUST A BIT TOO FAR.
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS WHEN
THE TIME COMES.
BY ANY CHANCE,
DID YOU BRING SOME
ICE WITH YOU FROM
BACK THERE?
NO? NEVER MIND.
I'LL STILL GIVE
YOU A TIP:
IT'S OFTEN SAFER
TO BE THE CHASER
THAN THE CHASED.
IF THE ROAD AHEAD
SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE,
YOU MIGHT NEED TO
FIND ANOTHER ROAD.
IN OTHER WORDS --
IF AT FIRST YOU
DON'T SUCCEED, TRY
SOMETHING ELSE.
I'VE TOLD YOU THIS
BEFORE, BUT IT'S
WORTH REPEATING.
REMEMBER, YOU CAN
GET IN BIG TROUBLE
IF YOU ALWAYS HOP
ON THE FIRST RIDE
THAT COMES ALONG.
BAD NEWS, MY FINE-
FLIPPERED FRIEND.
I DON'T SEE AN
HOUR GLASS OR A
CHECKPOINT ANYWHERE
AROUND HERE.
YOU'RE REALLY GOING
TO HAVE TO HOP
LIKE A BUNNY TO GET
ACROSS IN TIME.
DANGER LIES AHEAD.
WHEN YOU REACH THE
CHECKPOINT, TAKE A
MOMENT TO WATCH THE
SPIDER UP ABOVE.
LIKE ALL INSECTS,
HE'S A CREATURE OF
HABIT. LEARN HIS
PATH BEFORE YOU
CHOOSE YOURS.
THE MINE CARS ARE
SAFE TO RIDE. BUT
WATCH OUT FOR THE
RAILS. THEY'LL FRY
YOUR LEGS FASTER
THAN A FANCY CHEF.
A LITTLE TIP --
FEEL FREE TO HITCH
A LIFT FROM THE
BIRDS. HEDREN HAWKS
ARE ALWAYS NICE
TO FROGS.
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.
GOOD THING, TOO.
I'M ALL OUT OF TIPS.
