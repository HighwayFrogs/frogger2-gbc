 FIVE LITTLE FROGS
  WANDERED ACROSS
  THE POND. YOU'D
  BETTER GO LOOK
     FOR THEM.
		


THE GUY WHO GAVE ME
DIRECTIONS SAID I'D
COME TO A DEAD END.
I WONDER IF HE MEANT
  ME OR THE ROAD?
		

 WATCH OUT FOR THE
  WALL OF 'DOZERS.



    THERE'S BEEN
    AN OIL SPILL.
   WHOSE SLIDE ARE
       YOU ON?
		


      OH NO!
 SOMEONE MUST HAVE
A FLAT TIRE. I HEAR
  LOTS OF HISSING.
		


  HOW COME ALL THE
  OTHER FROGS KNOW
     HOW TO SWIM?
		


   WELCOME TO THE
   TREASURE ROOM.
   CHECK OUT ALL 
    THE DIAMONDS.

		

 GUESS IT'S MY TURN
    AT BAT AGAIN.




  YIKES!  ANOTHER
  TREASURE ROOM. I
  WONDER IF ANY OF
 THESE SPIDERS HAS
    A WEB SITE?

   I'LL TREASURE
   THESE MOMENTS.

  WOW. YOU MADE IT
  THIS FAR. THAT'S
     FANTASTIC.
	


  THIS PLACE LOOKS
  DANGEROUS. I HEAR
RUMBLING -- AND IT'S
    NOT MY STOMACH.

  SOMETIMES I FEEL
      LIKE I'M
   WALKING ON AIR.

  WANT SOME ADVICE?
     NO STOPPIN',
    KEEP HOPPIN'.

 THE BOLDER I GET,
 THE MORE BOULDERS
       I GET.

    DO YOU LIKE
     THE MUSIC?
 IT'S CROC AND ROLL.

 HEY, I DON'T HEAR
 ANY MORE RUMBLING.
   THAT'S GREAT...
      I THINK...
	

		

  THIS IS AN ICE
  PLACE TO VISIT,
  BUT THERE'S SNOW
  PLACE LIKE HOME.

  THIS PLACE GIVES
    ME THE CHILLS.
 AND THE LAST THING
   A FROG NEEDS IS
    GOOSE BUMPS.


   LIFE HAS IT'S
   UPS AND DOWNS.
    SO DOES ICE.

		


  ODDLY ENOUGH, I
 DON'T FEEL SO HOT.
    I THINK I'M
  CATCHING A COLD.
	

I'M SO COLD I CAN'T
  FEEL MY THUMBS.
 WAIT, I FORGOT...
 FROGS DON'T HAVE
   ANY THUMBS.


	

     CHILL OUT.

 COOL, AN OLD MINE.
  I COULD FALL FOR
 A PLACE LIKE THIS.

     MINE! MINE!
   IT'S ALL MINE!

  TIME TO BOLDLY
CROAK WHERE NO FROG
 HAS CROAKED BEFORE.
	



  THIS LOOKS LIKE
  A PLACE TO FIND
 FLAME AND FORTUNE.

  A FROG WHO LEAPS
    WITHOUT FIRST
       LOOKING,
  ENDS HIS DAYS IN
   LAVA, COOKING.

     IF I DON'T
    GET THROUGH,
    I THINK I'LL
     GET FIRED.
	

 I'LL HAVE TO CROSS
  THIS LAVA RIVER
   ASBESTOS I CAN.

  I'LL HAVE SOME
  RIBBITING TALES
 TO TELL IF I EVER
   GET BACK HOME.


OH NO! NOW IT LOOKS
LIKE MY GOOSE BUMPS
  WILL GET COOKED.


HI. I'M TADIUS.
KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR ME DURING
YOUR ADVENTURE.
I'LL GIVE YOU A
TIP WHENEVER I CAN.
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT TO DO HERE --
AVOID CARS, RIDE
THE LOGS, AND DON'T
FALL IN THE WATER.
GOOD LUCK.
	

ROUGH ROAD.
GLAD YOU MADE IT.
AS YOU CROSS THE
REST OF THE POND,
YOU'LL NOTICE THAT
SOME TURTLES SINK
BENEATH THE WATER.
MAKE SURE YOU HOP
OFF BEFORE THEY
GO UNDER.


GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HERE'S A TIP:
SNAKE'S HEAD
MAKES FROG DEAD.
SNAKE'S BACK
CAN'T ATTACK.


I HEARD A SNAKE
ONCE SCARED A MAN
SO MUCH THAT HE
DROPPED FOUR GEMS
IN THE TALL GRASS.
BY THE WAY, DID YOU
FIND THE CHECKPOINT
IN THE WATER? IT'S
EASY TO SLIP UP
AROUND HERE SO YOU
MIGHT WANT TO PAY
IT A VISIT.



WELL DONE.
THAT BURROW TO THE
LEFT SHOULD LEAD
YOU WHERE YOU NEED
TO GO.

THE POND IS A
LOT LIKE LIFE.
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
BEST TO JUMP AT THE
FIRST OPPORTUNITY
THAT FLOATS BY.
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IF YOU WAIT TOO
LONG, YOU'RE SUNK.
	
	

YOU CAN RIDE THE
MOVING BELT. BUT
WATCH OUT FOR THOSE
GLOWING CAULDRONS.
THEY LOOK RED HOT.
TRY NOT TO FALL OFF
THE EDGE, EITHER.
HMMMM. I DON'T SEE
ANY WAY TO GET OUT
OF HERE. DO YOU?

YOU CAN RIDE THE
GATOR'S BODY.
JUST STAY AWAY
FROM THE SNOUT.


I'M TADIUS'S TWIN
BROTHER, GORF. HE
FORGOT TO GIVE YOU
AN IMPORTANT TIP.
A JUMP FROM A 
MOVING PLATFORM TO
A SMALL OPENING CAN
BE TRICKY. BUT IF
YOU PRESS THE KEYPAD
SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF
TIME AND HOLD IT,
YOU'LL MAKE THE
JUMP JUST RIGHT.
	

I KNOW YOU
WANT TO DASH
STRAIGHT NORTH.
BUT WHEN THE TRACK
IS DENSELY PACKED,
A SMART FROG
ZIGZAGS BACK
AND FORTH.


I KNOW YOU
WANT TO DASH
STRAIGHT NORTH.
BUT WHEN
  THE TRACK
    IS DENSELY
         PACKED,
          A SMART
        FROG
    ZIGZAGS
 BACK
    AND
      FORTH.
	



YOU CAN LEAVE THE
INVISIBLE PATH
FOR A PLATFORM,
AND SAFELY RETURN.
JUST REMEMBER, YOU
CAN ONLY JUMP ON
EACH SPOT ONCE.
SO YOU CAN'T GO
BACK TO THE PLACE
YOU LEFT. YOU MUST
GO TO THE NEXT
STEP ON THE PATH.
	
	

A GATOR'S NOT
 A CROC.
A FROG IS NOT
 A TOAD.
AND THERE IS NOT
 ONE RESTING SPOT
DEPLOYED ALONG
 THIS ROAD.
	

	
    PATIENCE...

	

ON SLIPPERY ICE,
IT'S BEST TO PLAN
AHEAD. BE SURE TO
SEARCH CAREFULLY
FOR THE PATH.
THERE IS ALWAYS
A SAFE ROUTE. YOU
CAN TEST YOUR LUCK
WITH A JUMP INTO THE
UNKNOWN, BUT YOU'LL
PROBABLY END UP IN
THE WATER. AND THE
WATER IS COLD
ENOUGH TO TURN YOU
INTO A FROGSICLE.

		 

YOU'RE IN LUCK.
THOSE ARE PELCZARSKI
PENGUINS UP AHEAD.
THEY'RE FRIENDLY AND
HAPPY TO GIVE YOU
A RIDE.
	

BE VERY PATIENT.
WATCH FOR FISH
CROSSING YOUR PATH
BEFORE YOU JUMP.
AND DON'T JUST
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE
GOING. PAY SOME
ATTENTION TO WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN. THE
INFORMATION MIGHT
COME IN HANDY LATER.


	

	

I'M FREEZING.
ENOUGH OF THIS.
I'M GOING TO FIND
SOME PLACE THAT'S
NICE AND WARM.
BY THE WAY, YOU CAN
JUMP BACK AND FORTH
BETWEEN RIDES THAT
ARE MOVING IN
OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
WHILE YOU WAIT FOR A
SAFE CHANCE TO
MOVE AHEAD.


YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GO
WITH THE FLOW.
BUT WHEN YOU GO
AGAINST THE FLOW,
YOU'LL FIND IT'S
EASIER IF YOU DASH
JUST A BIT TOO FAR.
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS WHEN
THE TIME COMES.

	

BY ANY CHANCE,
DID YOU BRING SOME
ICE WITH YOU FROM
BACK THERE?
NO? NEVER MIND.
I'LL STILL GIVE
YOU A TIP:
IT'S OFTEN SAFER
TO BE THE CHASER
THAN THE CHASED.



IF THE ROAD AHEAD
SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE,
YOU MIGHT NEED TO
FIND ANOTHER ROAD.
IN OTHER WORDS --
IF AT FIRST YOU
DON'T SUCCEED, TRY
SOMETHING ELSE.


I'VE TOLD YOU THIS
BEFORE, BUT IT'S
WORTH REPEATING.
REMEMBER, YOU CAN
GET IN BIG TROUBLE
IF YOU ALWAYS HOP
ON THE FIRST RIDE
THAT COMES ALONG.

BAD NEWS, MY
WEB-FOOTED FRIEND.
I DON'T SEE AN
HOUR GLASS OR A
CHECKPOINT ANYWHERE
AROUND HERE.
YOU'RE REALLY GOING
TO HAVE TO HOP
LIKE A BUNNY TO GET
ACROSS IN TIME.

	

	


DANGER LIES AHEAD.
WHEN YOU REACH THE
CHECKPOINT, TAKE A
MOMENT TO WATCH THE
SPIDER UP ABOVE.
LIKE ALL INSECTS,
HE'S A CREATURE OF
HABIT. LEARN HIS
PATH BEFORE YOU
CHOOSE YOURS.
	


THE MINE CARS ARE
SAFE TO RIDE. BUT
WATCH OUT FOR THE
RAILS. THEY'LL FRY
YOUR LEGS FASTER
THAN A FANCY CHEF.
A LITTLE TIP --
FEEL FREE TO HITCH
A LIFT FROM THE
BIRDS. HEDREN HAWKS
ARE ALWAYS NICE
TO FROGS.

	

YOU'RE NEARLY THERE.
GOOD THING, TOO.
I'M ALL OUT OF TIPS.
