HI. I'M TADIUS.
KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR ME DURING
YOUR ADVENTURE.
I'LL GIVE YOU A
TIP WHENEVER I CAN.
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT TO DO HERE --
AVOID CARS, RIDE
THE LOGS, AND DON'T
FALL IN THE WATER.
GOOD LUCK.
	db	$0
tp01
ROUGH ROAD.
GLAD YOU MADE IT.
AS YOU CROSS THE
REST OF THE POND,
YOU'LL NOTICE THAT
SOME TURTLES SINK
BENEATH THE WATER.
MAKE SURE YOU HOP
OFF BEFORE THEY
GO UNDER.

tp02		;0123456789abcdef0123
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HERE'S A TIP:
SNAKE'S HEAD
MAKES FROG DEAD.
SNAKE'S BACK
CAN'T ATTACK.

tp03
I HEARD A SNAKE
ONCE SCARED A MAN
SO MUCH THAT HE
DROPPED FOUR GEMS
IN THE TALL GRASS.
BY THE WAY, DID YOU
FIND THE CHECKPOINT
IN THE WATER? IT'S
EASY TO SLIP UP
AROUND HERE SO YOU
MIGHT WANT TO PAY
IT A VISIT.

tp04	  	;actually used for level 0 as a second tip

WELL DONE.
THAT BURROW TO THE
LEFT SHOULD LEAD
YOU WHERE YOU NEED
TO GO.
tp05
THE POND IS A
LOT LIKE LIFE.
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
BEST TO JUMP AT THE
FIRST OPPORTUNITY
THAT FLOATS BY.
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IF YOU WAIT TOO
LONG, YOU'RE SUNK.
	
	
tp06
YOU CAN RIDE THE
MOVING BELT. BUT
WATCH OUT FOR THOSE
GLOWING CAULDRONS.
THEY LOOK RED HOT.
TRY NOT TO FALL OFF
THE EDGE, EITHER.
HMMMM. I DON'T SEE
ANY WAY TO GET OUT
OF HERE. DO YOU?
tp07
YOU CAN RIDE THE
GATOR'S BODY.
JUST STAY AWAY
FROM THE SNOUT.

tp08			;used in w5l0
I'M TADIUS'S TWIN
BROTHER, GORF. HE
FORGOT TO GIVE YOU
AN IMPORTANT TIP.
A JUMP FROM A 
MOVING PLATFORM TO
A SMALL OPENING CAN
BE TRICKY. BUT IF
YOU PRESS THE KEYPAD
SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF
TIME AND HOLD IT,
YOU'LL MAKE THE
JUMP JUST RIGHT.

tp09
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO DASH STRAIGHT
TOWARD THE NORTH.
BUT SOMETIMES YOU
NEED TO ZIG-ZAG
BACK AND FORTH.
	db	0
tp0a
YOU CAN LEAVE THE
INVISIBLE PATH
FOR A PLATFORM,
AND SAFELY RETURN.
JUST REMEMBER, YOU
CAN ONLY JUMP ON
EACH SPOT ONCE.
SO YOU CAN'T GO
BACK TO THE PLACE
YOU LEFT. YOU MUST
GO TO THE NEXT
STEP ON THE PATH.

A GATOR'S NOT
 A CROC.
A FROG IS NOT
 A TOAD.

ON SLIPPERY ICE,
IT'S BEST TO PLAN
AHEAD. BE SURE TO
SEARCH CAREFULLY
FOR THE PATH.
THERE IS ALWAYS
A SAFE ROUTE. YOU
CAN TEST YOUR LUCK
WITH A JUMP INTO THE
UNKNOWN, BUT YOU'LL
PROBABLY END UP IN
THE WATER. AND THE
WATER IS COLD
ENOUGH TO TURN YOU
INTO A FROGSICLE.

		 
tp0f
YOU'RE IN LUCK.
THOSE ARE PELCZARSKI
PENGUINS UP AHEAD.
THEY'RE FRIENDLY AND
HAPPY TO GIVE YOU
A RIDE.
	db	0
tp10
BE VERY PATIENT.
WATCH FOR FISH
CROSSING YOUR PATH
BEFORE YOU JUMP.
AND DON'T JUST
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE
GOING. PAY SOME
ATTENTION TO WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN. THE
INFORMATION MIGHT
COME IN HANDY LATER.

I'M FREEZING.
ENOUGH OF THIS.
I'M GOING TO FIND
SOME PLACE THAT'S
NICE AND WARM.
BY THE WAY, YOU CAN
JUMP BACK AND FORTH
BETWEEN RIDES THAT
ARE MOVING IN
OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
WHILE YOU WAIT FOR A
SAFE CHANCE TO
MOVE AHEAD.

tp14
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GO
WITH THE FLOW.
BUT WHEN YOU GO
AGAINST THE FLOW,
YOU'LL FIND IT'S
EASIER IF YOU DASH
JUST A BIT TOO FAR.
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS WHEN
THE TIME COMES.

	
tp15
BY ANY CHANCE,
DID YOU BRING SOME
ICE WITH YOU FROM
BACK THERE?
NO? NEVER MIND.
I'LL STILL GIVE
YOU A TIP:
IT'S OFTEN SAFER
TO BE THE CHASER
THAN THE CHASED.


tp16
IF THE ROAD AHEAD
SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE,
YOU MIGHT NEED TO
FIND ANOTHER ROAD.
IN OTHER WORDS --
IF AT FIRST YOU
DON'T SUCCEED, TRY
SOMETHING ELSE.

tp17
I'VE TOLD YOU THIS
BEFORE, BUT IT'S
WORTH REPEATING.
REMEMBER, YOU CAN
GET IN BIG TROUBLE
IF YOU ALWAYS HOP
ON THE FIRST RIDE
THAT COMES ALONG.
tp18
BAD NEWS, MY
WEB-FOOTED FRIEND.
I DON'T SEE AN
HOUR GLASS OR A
CHECKPOINT ANYWHERE
AROUND HERE.
YOU'RE REALLY GOING
TO HAVE TO HOP
LIKE A BUNNY TO GET
ACROSS IN TIME.

DANGER LIES AHEAD.
WHEN YOU REACH THE
CHECKPOINT, TAKE A
MOMENT TO WATCH THE
SPIDER UP ABOVE.
LIKE ALL INSECTS,
HE'S A CREATURE OF
HABIT. LEARN HIS
PATH BEFORE YOU
CHOOSE YOURS.

tp1c		;0123456789abcdef0123
THE MINE CARS ARE
SAFE TO RIDE. BUT
WATCH OUT FOR THE
RAILS. THEY'LL FRY
YOUR LEGS FASTER
THAN A FANCY CHEF.
A LITTLE TIP --
FEEL FREE TO HITCH
A LIFT FROM THE
BIRDS. HEDREN HAWKS
ARE ALWAYS NICE
TO FROGS.
