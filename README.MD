# Frogger 2 (Game Boy / Game Boy Color)
The official source code to Frogger 2 for Game Boy and Game Boy Color.  
This code builds a perfect match to the retail build [Frogger 2 (USA) (Rev 1)](https://gamehacking.org/game/128029).  
**Developer:** Morning Star Media  
**Programmer:** David Lubar  

## How to build?
Due to the age of the game and programs, something which can run 16-bit DOS executables is necessary to build this.  
Testing has been done with [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1).  

**1)** Mount your frogger-gbc folder in DOSBox.  
Command: `mount X C:\{path to frogger2-gbc}\frogger2-gbc`  

**2)** Switch to the drive letter 'X', which is your frogger-gbc folder.  
Command: `X:`  

**3)** Assemble the ROM by running `MAKE.BAT`.  
The ROM will be called `frogger2.bin`.
